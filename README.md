Rails version: 7.0.3.1

Ruby version: 3.1.2p20

The program has a scaffold for each of the following: Students, Prefixes. Courses, Semesters, Sections and Students. A user can create, delete, update students and others. Associations has been made for each of the above scaffolds. I changed the layout and the font using a CSS bootstrap. I have also included a search bar at the top. I have also added the quick links for (Students, Sections, Prefixes, Semesters and Courses) under the search bar, and when I try to create a course for example, the drop down for the prefixes will work.
